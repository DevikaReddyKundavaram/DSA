# Next Greater Element in Circular Array

## üìå Problem Statement
Given a circular integer array `arr[]`, the task is to determine the **next greater element (NGE)** for each element in the array.

The next greater element of an element `arr[i]` is the first element that is greater than `arr[i]` when traversing **circularly**. If no such element exists, return `-1` for that position.

## ‚úÖ Examples
```text
Example 1
Input: arr = [1, 3, 2, 4]
Output: [3, 4, 4, -1]
Explanation:
- The next greater element for 1 is 3.
- The next greater element for 3 is 4.
- The next greater element for 2 is 4.
- The next greater element for 4 does not exist, so return -1.

Example 2
Input: arr = [0, 2, 3, 1, 1]
Output: [2, 3, -1, 2, 2]
Explanation:
- The next greater element for 0 is 2.
- The next greater element for 2 is 3.
- The next greater element for 3 does not exist, so return -1.
- The next greater element for 1 is 2 (from circular traversal).
- The next greater element for 1 is 2 (from circular traversal).

## üîë Constraints
- `1 ‚â§ arr.size() ‚â§ 10^5`  
- `0 ‚â§ arr[i] ‚â§ 10^6`

## üí° Approach
1. Since the array is **circular**, we need to traverse it **twice**.
2. Use a **monotonic stack** to store indices of elements whose next greater element is not yet found.
3. Traverse the array from **right ‚Üí left** (simulate circularity).
4. For each element:
   - Pop smaller/equal elements from the stack.
   - If stack is not empty, the **top element is the NGE**.
   - Otherwise, mark `-1`.
   - Push current index into stack.

## üìù Code (Python)

```python
class Solution:
    def nextGreater(self, arr):
        n = len(arr)
        res = [-1] * n   # result array
        st = []          # stack to store indices

        # traverse 2n times (circular array)
        for i in range(2 * n - 1, -1, -1):
            while st and arr[st[-1]] <= arr[i % n]:
                st.pop()
            if st:
                res[i % n] = arr[st[-1]]
            st.append(i % n)
        
        return res
```
