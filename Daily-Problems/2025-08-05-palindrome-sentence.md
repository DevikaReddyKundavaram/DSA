# 🧩 Problem: Palindrome Sentence
---

## 📝 Problem Statement

Given a single string `s`, check whether it is a **palindrome sentence** or not.

A palindrome sentence is a sequence of characters (word, phrase, or symbols) that reads the same backward as forward **after**:
- Converting all uppercase letters to lowercase.
- Removing all **non-alphanumeric** characters (including spaces and punctuation).

---

## 📥 Input

- A string `s`, where `1 ≤ len(s) ≤ 10⁶`.

---

## 📤 Output

- Return `True` if the string is a palindrome sentence.
- Else return `False`.

---

## 🧪 Examples
```text
### Example 1:
Input: "Too hot to hoot"
Output: True
Explanation: After removing non-alphanumeric characters and lowercasing, we get "toohottohoot", which is a palindrome.

Input: "Abc 012..## 10cbA"
Output: True
Explanation: After cleaning, we get "abc01210cba", which is a palindrome.
```

## 🧠 Algorithm: Check Palindrome Sentence

**Input:** A string `s`  
**Output:** `True` if the cleaned string is a palindrome, otherwise `False`

### 🔄 Steps:

1. Initialize an empty list `cleaned` to store valid characters.
2. Loop through each character `ch` in the string `s`:
   - If `ch` is **alphanumeric**:
     - Convert `ch` to **lowercase** and append it to `cleaned`.
3. Compare the cleaned list with its reverse:
   - If `cleaned == cleaned[::-1]`, return `True`.
   - Else, return `False`.

---

### ✅ Example Walkthrough:

**Input:** `"Too hot to hoot"`  
- Remove non-alphanumeric: `"toohottohoot"`  ## ⏱️ Time and Space Complexity

### 🧮 Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**: We traverse the input string once to filter and process alphanumeric characters. Comparing the cleaned string with its reverse also takes linear time.

### 🧠 Space Complexity:
- **O(n)**: We store a filtered version of the string (`cleaned`), which in the worst case could be the entire input if all characters are alphanumeric.

class Solution:
    def isPalinSent(self, s):
        cleaned = ""
        for ch in s:
            if ch.isalnum():
                cleaned += ch.lower()
        return cleaned == cleaned[::-1]
```

## 🚀 Applications of Palindrome Sentence Checking

1. **Text Normalization & Data Cleaning**  
   - Removing non-alphanumeric characters and handling case sensitivity is a key preprocessing step in NLP tasks like sentiment analysis or chatbot input processing.

2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**  
   - Useful in detecting palindromic structures in poetry or literature for stylistic analysis.
   - Plays a role in language pattern recognition, particularly in symmetrical language constructs.

3. **Plagiarism Detection & Text Similarity**  
   - Detecting reversed repetitions or mirrored phrases could enhance similarity detection between texts.

4. **Security and Cryptography**  
   - Palindromic patterns sometimes appear in symmetric key design or hash collision analysis.

5. **Puzzles & Games**  
   - Core logic for palindrome-based challenges in coding contests, educational games, and brain teasers.

6. **Search Engine Query Optimization**  
   - Helps in recognizing and simplifying mirrored or reversed user queries.

7. **Error Detection in DNA Sequences**  
   - In bioinformatics, palindromic DNA sequences (reverse complements) are biologically significant and useful in genetic research.

8. **Symmetry Detection in AI/ML Vision Tasks**  
   - Conceptually similar logic can be used for detecting symmetry in images and object structures.
