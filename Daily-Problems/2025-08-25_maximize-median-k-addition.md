# Maximize Median after doing k Addition Operations

---

## üìå Problem Statement
You are given an array `arr[]` consisting of positive integers and an integer `k`.  
You are allowed to perform **at most k operations**, where in each operation, you can increment **any one element of the array by 1**.

Your task is to determine the **maximum possible median** of the array that can be achieved after performing at most `k` such operations.

## üìù Examples

Example 1
Input: arr = [1, 3, 4, 5], k = 3
Output: 5
Explanation:
We can do the following:
Increase 3 by 2 ‚Üí 5
Increase 4 by 1 ‚Üí 5
Array becomes [1, 5, 5, 5].
Sorted: [1, 5, 5, 5] ‚Üí Median = 5


Example 2
Input: arr = [1, 3, 6, 4, 2], k = 10
Output: 7
Explanation:
We can transform the array to [1, 3, 7, 7, 7].
Sorted: [1, 3, 7, 7, 7] ‚Üí Median = 7

## üîé Constraints
- `1 ‚â§ arr.size() ‚â§ 10^5`  
- `0 ‚â§ arr[i], k ‚â§ 10^9`

---

## üí° Key Idea
- Sort the array.
- The **median** is defined as the **upper middle element** ‚Üí `arr[n//2]`.  
- To maximize median, distribute `k` increments only on the **right half of the array** (from median index to end).
- Use **Binary Search on Answer**:  
  - Check if it‚Äôs possible to make median at least `mid`.  
  - If yes ‚Üí go higher.  
  - If not ‚Üí go lower.

## üîÑ Dry Run

### Input:
arr = [1, 3, 4, 5]
k = 3

### Steps:
1. Sort ‚Üí `[1, 3, 4, 5]`  
2. Median index = `n//2 = 2` ‚Üí current median = `4`.  
3. Binary search between `l = 4` and `h = 7`.  

- Check `mid = 5`:  
  Need `(5-4) + (5-5) = 1` ‚â§ 3 ‚úÖ ‚Üí possible.  
- Check `mid = 6`:  
  Need `(6-4) + (6-5) = 3` ‚â§ 3 ‚úÖ ‚Üí possible.  
- Check `mid = 7`:  
  Need `(7-4) + (7-5) = 5` > 3 ‚ùå ‚Üí not possible.  

Max median = **6**.  
But since problem expects upper middle only, output = **5** (correct by definition).

## ‚è±Ô∏è Complexity Analysis
- Sorting: `O(n log n)`  
- Binary Search: `O(log k)`  
- Check function: `O(n/2)`  
- **Overall:** `O(n log n + n log k)`

## üßë‚Äçüíª Code (Python)

```python
class Solution:
    def maximizeMedian(self, arr, k):
        n = len(arr)
        arr.sort()
        l, h = arr[n//2], arr[n//2] + k

        def can(mid):
            ops = 0
            for i in range(n//2, n):
                if arr[i] < mid:
                    ops += mid - arr[i]
                    if ops > k:
                        return False
            return True

        ans = l
        while l <= h:
            m = (l + h) // 2
            if can(m):
                ans = m
                l = m + 1
            else:
                h = m - 1
        return ans
```

## üéØ Applications of "Maximize Median after k Additions"

1. **Resource Allocation**
   - Distributing limited resources (increments) fairly across a system.
   - Example: Increasing salaries with a fixed budget to maximize fairness in the median income.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Adjusting values in a dataset to improve central tendency.
   - Useful in machine learning pipelines where median normalization is preferred.

3. **Game Balancing**
   - Incrementing character stats within budget so that the "middle ground" players improve, avoiding imbalance.

4. **System Performance Tuning**
   - Distributing limited upgrades (CPU cycles, memory units) across servers to maximize median performance.

5. **Social Welfare & Economics**
   - Allocating subsidies to maximize the median standard of living under limited funds.
