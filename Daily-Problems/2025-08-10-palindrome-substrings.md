# Problem: Palindrome SubStrings
---

## üìú Problem Statement
Given a string `s`, count all **palindromic substrings** present in the string, where the length of the substring is **greater than or equal to 2**.  
A substring is palindromic if it reads the same forwards and backwards.

---

## üìù Input / Output

**Input:**  
- A string `s` containing only lowercase English letters.

**Output:**  
- An integer representing the count of palindromic substrings with length ‚â• 2.

## üîç Examples

**Example 1:**
Input: s = "abaab" Output: 3 Explanation: "aba", "aa", "baab"

**Example 2:**

Input: s = "aaa" Output: 3 Explanation: "aa", "aa", "aaa"

**Example 3:**

Input: s = "abbaeae" Output: 4 Explanation: "bb", "abba", "aea", "eae"
```

## üîπ Constraints

- 2 ‚â§ s.size() ‚â§ 5 √ó 10^3 s contains only lowercase English letters

## ‚öôÔ∏è Algorithm
**Approach: Expand Around Center**
1. Iterate over every character in the string, considering each as the center of a possible palindrome.
2. For each center, expand outward in both directions (left and right) while the characters match.
3. Count palindromes only if their length ‚â• 2.
4. Do this for:
   - **Odd-length palindromes** (center at a single character).
   - **Even-length palindromes** (center between two characters).
5. Return the total count.

### ‚è≥ Complexity Analysis

**Time Complexity:**  
- **Worst case:** `O(n¬≤)` ‚Äì For each character as the center, expansion can take up to `n/2` steps in both directions.  
- **Best case:** `O(n)` ‚Äì When no expansions occur beyond one step (all characters are different).  

**Space Complexity:**  
- `O(1)` ‚Äì Uses constant extra space for pointers/counters only.

## üñ•Ô∏è Code Implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def countPS(self, s):
        n = len(s)
        count = 0
        
        def expand(l, r):
            nonlocal count
            while l >= 0 and r < n and s[l] == s[r]:
                if r - l + 1 >= 2:
                    count += 1
                l -= 1
                r += 1
        
        for center in range(n):
            expand(center, center)       # Odd length
            expand(center, center + 1)   # Even length
        
        return count
```
