# üïí Difference Check

## üßæ Problem Statement

Given an array `arr[]` of time strings in **24-hour clock format** `"HH:MM:SS"`, return the **minimum difference** in **seconds** between any two time strings in the array.

üïõ The clock wraps around at midnight, so the time difference between `"23:59:59"` and `"00:00:00"` is **1 second**.

---

## üî¢ Input

- An array `arr[]` of strings of format `"HH:MM:SS"`
- `2 ‚â§ arr.length ‚â§ 10‚Åµ`
- Each time is a valid string in 24-hour format

---

## üì§ Output

- Return an integer: the minimum time difference in **seconds**.

## üß† Examples

### Example 1
**Input:**  
`arr = ["12:30:15", "12:30:45"]`  
**Output:**  
`30`  
**Explanation:**  
Difference between both times is 30 seconds.

---

### Example 2
**Input:**  
`arr = ["00:00:01", "23:59:59", "00:00:05"]`  
**Output:**  
`2`  
**Explanation:**  
Minimum difference is between `23:59:59` and `00:00:01` = 2 seconds (wrap-around logic).

---

## üßÆ Algorithm

1. Convert all `"HH:MM:SS"` strings to **total seconds** since midnight.
2. Sort the list of total seconds.
3. Traverse through sorted list and compute the **difference** between consecutive elements.
4. Also compute **wrap-around** difference (between last and first: `86400 + first - last`).
5. Return the **minimum difference** found.

| üïí **Time Complexity**  | `O(n log n)`           | Sorting the `n` time values after converting them to seconds.                  |
| üß† **Space Complexity** | `O(n)`                 | Extra space used to store all time values as seconds in a new list.            |

## üß† Code (Python)

```python
class Solution:
    def minDifference(self, arr):
        def to_seconds(time_str):
            h, m, s = map(int, time_str.split(':'))
            return h * 3600 + m * 60 + s

        times = sorted(to_seconds(t) for t in arr)
        min_diff = float('inf')
        
        for i in range(1, len(times)):
            min_diff = min(min_diff, times[i] - times[i - 1])
        
        # wrap-around difference between last and first
        wrap_around = 86400 - times[-1] + times[0]
        min_diff = min(min_diff, wrap_around)

        return min_diff
```
